Description:

    Generate the platform scaffold for the Bootstrap framework.

Example:

    rails generate repres:bootstrap:platform administration --version 4

    This will insert the following routing into the config/routes.rb:

        namespace :administration do
          namespace :v4 do
            resources :dashboards, only: :show
          end
        end

    This will create the following files:

        app/assets/images/administration/v4/.keep
        app/assets/images/shared/.keep
        app/assets/images/administration/v4/shared/.keep
        app/assets/javascripts/administration/v4/.keep
        app/assets/javascripts/shared/.keep
        app/assets/javascripts/administration/v4/shared/.keep
        app/assets/stylesheets/administration/v4/.keep
        app/assets/stylesheets/shared/.keep
        app/assets/stylesheets/administration/v4/shared/.keep
        app/controllers/concerns/priviledge_protection.rb
        app/controllers/administration/v4/privileged_controller.rb
        app/controllers/administration/v4/dashboards_controller.rb
        app/helpers/administration/v4/application_helper.rb
        app/views/layouts/administration/v4.html.erb
        app/views/shared/.keep
        app/views/administration/v4/shared/_script.html.erb
        app/views/administration/v4/shared/_style.html.erb
